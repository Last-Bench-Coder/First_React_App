# How to create our first react application
It is simple react app created with the help of command [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)

```
npm/npx create-react-app <<app name>>
```

###### Have a look Some difference between npx vs npm

NPM | NPX
------------ | -------------
The npm stands for Node Package Manager | The npx stands for Node Package Execute
NPM by itself does not simply run any package. If you want to run a package using NPM, you must specify that package in your package.json file. | NPX will check whether <command> exists in $PATH, or in the local project binaries, and execute it, also is the ability to execute a package which wasn't previously installed.
When executables are installed via NPM packages, NPM links to them: 1. local installs have "links" created at ./node_modules/.bin/ directory. 2. global installs have "links" created from the global bin/ directory (e.g. /usr/local/bin) | npx command may be helpful in the script section of a package.json file, when it is unwanted to define a dependency which might not be commonly used or any other reason: Example  "start": "npx gulp@3.9.1"



Before you start creating the app, please check whether node js is installed in your machine. 

Please run below command in command prompt.

## Lets Start Creating the app

Use below mentioned command to create the new react app

```
create-react-app first-react-app
```

Sometime you will get error like `'create-react-app' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.` it is due to command is not regstered globaly. Use below command to register the create-react-app then run again `create-react-app first-react-app`.

```
npm install create-react-app -g
```

OR use below command to create the react app(i.e with the help of *npx*)

```
npx create-react-app first-react-app
```

The above command generate a react app boilerplate within the path the command had run in, and ensures that you always use the latest version of a generator or build tool without having to upgrade each time youâ€™re about to use it.
